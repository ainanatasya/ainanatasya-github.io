<p align="justify"><font face="arial"><i>I visited my auntie in Langkawi, Kedah, last year. 
I went to Langkawi by myself, and the aim for my visit 
was to relieve my head after experiencing challenges in semester 3. 
My auntie, who runs a restaurant in Pulau Tuba, invited me to join 
her on a trip to Pulau Tuba after I arrived. Pulau Tuba is a lovely, 
isolated island located 5 kilometres southwest of Kuah Jetty. There is 
a traditional fishing town there, as well as uncommon wildlife and 
vegetation and a handful of homestays. Apart from the main Langkawi Island, 
it is also the only inhabited islet in the area, and can be reached through 
a 20-minute boat journey from Kuah Jetty. When they are not fishing or farming, 
villagers on the island have a very conventional lifestyle, venturing into the 
forest-covered hills to harvest medicinal plants, fruits, and honey. I really 
enjoyed my experience of being here. Here are a few of my Pulau Tuba photographs and video. 
Feel free to have a look!</p></i>
